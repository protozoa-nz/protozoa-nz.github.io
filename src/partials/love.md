We love working with people. We're not just devs - we are also skilled teachers, facilitators, and project managers.
Our experience across domains makes us excellent guides and interpreters.

Technology is hard. Communicating clearly and working together to solve problems is harder. We work with you to discover and solve problems in a creative and enjoyable way.

Working on dynamic open source projects means we put collaboration at the centre, and we're used to creating something out of nothing. Every person and project is unique - we would love to develop a process that works best for you.
