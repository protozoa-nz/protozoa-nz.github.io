## Services

### Web Development

Do you have a great idea for an app or website? Do you need extra capacity in your dev team? 
We can help! We create efficient applications that work as websites or mobile apps.
Our specialties include "offline first" applications that work with minimal or no internet), and security/cryptography.

We get you working software _you can use_ as fast as possible, and then improve it with feedback.
This means you'll get the app you need, with better control over the budget.

### Training

**Technical**

Up-skill your team in the latest javascript technologies.
We run on-site or remote trainings for developers.
We can teach your seniors how to support juniors, and help establish agile processes.

**Non-technical**

Do you sometimes feel like your developers are speaking another language?
We're experts at translating from the tech into plain English.
Work more effectively with better communication among your staff.

## Things we Love

### Code

We dream [new possibilities](http://www.scuttlebutt.nz) into being in our spare time. This work brings us foresight about where the web is going, and keeps us sharp.


### Humans

We love working with people. We're not just devs - we are also skilled teachers, facilitators, and project managers.
Our experience across domains makes us excellent guides and interpreters.

Technology is hard. Communicating clearly and working together to solve problems is harder. We work with you to discover and solve problems in a creative and enjoyable way.


### Process 

Working on dynamic open source projects means we put collaboration at the centre, and we're used to creating something out of nothing. Every person and project is unique - we would love to develop a process that works best for you.
